# ao-nds

[Attorney Online](https://aceattorneyonline.com) client for the Nintendo DS.

Made with devkitARM & libnds by Headshotnoby

**STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT!**
This homebrew does not connect online yet.
I still have to finish writing code that handles these:
- [x] Backgrounds
- [x] Desk sprites
- [ ] Character sprites
- [ ] Chatbox
- [ } Evidence sprites
- [x] Music
- [ ] Sound effects

Before you can use this, you need to use the AO NDS converter tool
to convert the contents of the base folder from the PC version to formats that are compatible with the NDS.
